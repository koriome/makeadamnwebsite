    everyone has the ability to build their own website today.
    front-end devs and fancy social media pages make it look hard! framework this, javascript that.
    who gives a shit? all you need is a vision and the tools to build it, and i want to give you the latter.
    i want to equip you with the tools to create your own corner on the internet.
    stop renting space from your digital landlords at facebook or twitter.
    making a website is taking control of your identity in an internet landscape that wants to reduce us all to numbers.
    join me in curating a more personal web, make your own website.

       that's fine! making a website with a builder
       is much easier than typing it all out by hand.
       be aware of the scope of your page, though, it could be costly!

        sweet! you'll need a base level understanding of HTML and CSS,
        maybe even some javascript for interactivity. it can be complicated at first,
        but there are many free static site hosters!
